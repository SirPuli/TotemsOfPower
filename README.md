# Totems of Power
## This mod adds totems similar to the Totem of Undying.
#### The totems so far:
##### Totem of Speed: Gives you speed boost. Tier 1-4
##### Totem of Jumping: Gives you jump boost. Tier 1-2
##### Totem of Fire Resistance: Gives you fire resistance. Tier 1
##### Totem of Luck: Gives you luck. Tier 1

#### Higher tier totems are more rare but more powerful. For example a Tier 1 Totem of Speed gives you 'Speed I' and has a low durability and a Tier 4 version gives you 'Speed IV' and has a higher durability.
#### Most totems always active and when active looses durability over time. There are some exception. The Totem of Fire Resistance only active when you are on fire and looses durability every second. 
#### *The totems only active in the offhand.*


## Plans:
##### - Totems for most vanilla potion effects.
##### - Ultimate Totem
